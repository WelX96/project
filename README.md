Hi!
This is a small website created by me, as my final project after finishing the front end course. It's a presentation website for a company located in usa, that sells guns, ammunition and accesories. Its based on a bootstrap arhitecture, its fully resposive and doesnt use any back-end tools( the main purpose was to be fully front-end based).
It's targeted for male  audience, as they are more likely to stop and ask informations about weapons. It gives a simplier look, with dark and green nuances to atract the target audience.
Structure:
1. Index:
    - Main area where it keeps the latest news, articles or general messages that apply to all users that come.
    - Important techniques used : JS to hide header logo on scroll down, without ruining the gradient background, animations are from an external library, JS media query to stop/add animation on a certain width point to preserve a clean mobile look/experience
2. Firearms:
    - This page contains all the guns the shops curently have for sale. It's switching , depending on the width, from a 4 cards grid, gradualy, to 1 card grid, as in final mobile form.
    - Important techniques used : JS and JQuery used to create a fully functional filter on DOM elements
3. Ammu and accesories
    - Same base idea as "Firearms" , instead with ammunition and accesories
    - Important techniques used : a sorting function ( JS/JQuery) using bubble sort (fewer elements to sort)
4. Contact
    - It contains the contact form. Because it doesnt use DB, we cant store the messages we get, but as an alternative, the form creates a JSON string, so that on further development it can be used to record the message
    - Important techniques used : JS to verify and show a message after the user submited the request, also, recording a JSON var, for any further use

This is the big picture of my website. It also include a lot of tricks to beautify the pages. The main focus of the page is to show the way i think when i'm coding.
I dont have any other projects because it would be sort of a copy paste, but if you are interested in what i can do, please leave a request with what you would like to see, and ill make it happen(somehow).

The end!
